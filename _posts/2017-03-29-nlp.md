### Understand your customers better by deciphering chat/reviews (texts).
In a highly competitive space, leveraging unstructured data is imperative to stay ahead of the curve. The obstacles faced while processing this data don't exist anymore thanks to many cloud solutions and api's

These NLP solutions though tend to be generic in nature, and if you too feel the services are not up to the mark, you are not alone.

My motivation primarily came from this, and in my investigation (and so surprisingly), there are tons of solutions readily available to plug this hole.

### Spark - Stanford NLP
Stanford NLP is really great to get you started with basics of NLP, they have a great many algorithms to tokenize and clean up; And to stem/lemmatize or morph your tokens.
Spark provides some very cool processing algorithms like Word2Vector!
